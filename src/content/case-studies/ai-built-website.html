    <h2 class="reveal">The Typical Way: Months and Tens of Thousands</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Building a brand from scratch and launching a production website is one of the most expensive, time-consuming things a startup does. The traditional path looks something like this:</p>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li><strong>Brand identity package</strong> — Logo, color palette, typography, brand voice, usage guidelines. Agencies charge $5,000–$15,000. Timeline: 3–6 weeks of discovery, mood boards, revisions, and finalization.</li>
      <li><strong>Custom website design &amp; development</strong> — Wireframes, mockups, responsive design, front-end code. A 10-page custom site runs $15,000–$30,000. Timeline: 6–12 weeks between design rounds, development sprints, and QA.</li>
      <li><strong>Professional copywriting</strong> — Marketing copy, case studies, blog posts, meta descriptions. $3,000–$5,000 for a full site. Timeline: 2–4 weeks with revision cycles.</li>
      <li><strong>SEO infrastructure</strong> — Structured data, sitemaps, meta tags, keyword strategy. $2,000–$5,000 for initial setup. Timeline: 1–2 weeks.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="reveal"><strong>Total: $30,000–$55,000 and 3–6 months.</strong> That's the going rate for what you're looking at right now — the site you're reading this on.</p>
    <p class="reveal">We spent $0 and did it in hours.</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">Our Way: Brand Guidelines → Slack → Production Site</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Here's what actually happened. We created comprehensive brand guidelines — our color system (Highland Moss greens, Frailejón Gold accents, Cloud Layer text on Páramo Deep backgrounds), typography (Source Serif 4 for display, Outfit for body), voice and tone principles, design spacing rules, accessibility standards.</p>
    <p class="reveal">Then we fed all of it into our AI agent's DNA files — the configuration system that shapes how our agent thinks, writes, and builds. The agent absorbed the entire brand identity instantly. It became a Staff+ full-stack engineer with a designer's eye and a copywriter's voice.</p>

    <div class="case-quote reveal">
      <p>"We described what we needed in Slack. The agent built it. We reviewed in browser, gave feedback, the agent iterated — often within minutes. The entire site was built from a Slack channel."</p>
    </div>

    <p class="reveal">No Figma. No wireframes. No mockup approval rounds. No "we'll have the next revision by Friday." We typed what we wanted in our <code>#cc-website</code> Slack channel, and the AI agent generated production-ready HTML, CSS, and copy — maintaining perfect brand consistency across every pixel and every word.</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">What the AI Built</h2>
    <p class="reveal">This wasn't "AI-assisted." The agent was the designer, developer, copywriter, and SEO specialist — all at once, all from Slack.</p>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">1</span> Complete Brand Identity</div>
      <p>The AI agent generated our entire brand system: a cohesive color palette inspired by the páramo ecosystem (deep greens, gold accents, misty sage), display and body typography pairing, component design language with consistent border radii and spacing, and animation principles. Every design decision has a reason rooted in the brand story.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">2</span> Custom HTML &amp; CSS — No Templates</div>
      <p>Every page is hand-tuned, responsive, accessible HTML and CSS. No WordPress. No Squarespace. No templates. No frameworks. Every layout decision, every media query, every hover state, every scroll-reveal animation — generated from brand guidelines. The code is clean enough that a senior engineer would be proud of it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">3</span> All Marketing Copy &amp; Content</div>
      <p>Hero headlines, feature descriptions, pricing tiers, calls to action, meta descriptions, 4 full case studies with problem/solution/result narratives, 4 long-form SEO-optimized blog posts. Every word written by the agent, maintaining our brand voice (authoritative yet approachable, technical yet accessible) across 10+ pages without a single style guide violation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">4</span> Full SEO &amp; AI Discoverability Infrastructure</div>
      <p>JSON-LD structured data (Organization, Article, FAQ schemas). LLM discoverability files (llms.txt, llms-full.txt). Auto-generated sitemaps via GitHub Actions. Canonical URLs. robots.txt with AI crawler access. Newsletter integration via Kit. Dual Google Analytics tracking. Everything a technical SEO specialist would implement.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">5</span> Pixel-Perfect Brand Consistency</div>
      <p>Across 10+ pages, the agent never deviated from the brand system. Not once. The same Highland Moss greens, the same Frailejón Gold accents, the same Source Serif 4 headlines, the same Outfit body text, the same Cloud Layer on Páramo Deep. A human design team would need a brand police officer to achieve this level of consistency. The AI just… does it.</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">The Workflow That Made It Possible</h2>
    <p class="reveal">The secret isn't some magic AI tool. It's the workflow:</p>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li><strong>Step 1: Build your brand guidelines.</strong> We defined our colors, typography, voice, design principles, and spacing rules. The AI agent helped create these too — drawing from our company story (named after the frailejón plant of the Andes) to build a cohesive visual and verbal identity.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 2: Feed them into the agent's DNA.</strong> The guidelines became part of the agent's operating system. It doesn't reference a PDF — it <em>is</em> the brand.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 3: Describe what you need in Slack.</strong> "Build a landing page with hero, services, pricing, and CTA." "Write a case study about our restaurant client." "Add a blog post about AI vs. Zapier." Natural language. No specs. No tickets.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 4: Review and iterate in minutes.</strong> The agent generates production code. You review in browser. Give feedback. The agent iterates. Changes that would take an agency a week happen in a conversation.</li>
      <li><strong>Step 5: Push to production.</strong> Commit, push, live. GitHub Pages deploys automatically. Done.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="case-quote reveal">
      <p>"The same workflow we used to build our own brand and website is exactly what we deploy for clients. We are the product. This site is the proof."</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="reveal">Why This Matters for Your Business</h2>
    <p class="reveal">If a 3-person startup can produce a brand identity and production website that looks like it cost $40,000+ — in hours, from a Slack channel — imagine what this approach can do for your business.</p>
    <p class="reveal">The traditional model of hiring designers, developers, copywriters, and SEO specialists isn't broken. It's just expensive and slow. AI agents don't replace the quality — they replace the overhead. The handoffs. The scheduling. The revision cycles. The waiting.</p>
    <p class="reveal">You get the same quality output. You just get it in hours instead of months, for a fraction of the cost.</p>
