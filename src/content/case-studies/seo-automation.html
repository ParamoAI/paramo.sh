    <h2 class="reveal">The Traditional Way: Agencies, Freelancers, and Tool Subscriptions</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Running a serious SEO operation — the kind that actually moves the needle — is expensive. Most businesses cobble together some combination of:</p>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li><strong>SEO agency retainer</strong> — Strategy, keyword research, technical audits, link building. $2,500–$3,500/month for a decent agency. More for a good one.</li>
      <li><strong>Content writers</strong> — Blog posts, landing pages, product copy. $500–$1,500/month for 2–3 quality pieces per week. More if you need domain expertise.</li>
      <li><strong>Programmatic SEO development</strong> — Template systems, data pipelines, page generators. $5,000–$15,000 one-time build, plus $500–$1,000/month for maintenance and iteration. Most companies never even attempt pSEO because the upfront cost is too high.</li>
      <li><strong>SEO tools &amp; monitoring</strong> — Ahrefs, SEMrush, Surfer, competitor tracking dashboards. $200–$500/month in subscriptions.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="reveal"><strong>Total: $3,000–$5,000/month ongoing.</strong> And that's before you factor in the coordination overhead — briefing writers, reviewing agency deliverables, managing freelancers, sitting in strategy calls.</p>
    <p class="reveal">We replaced all of it with a single AI agent, running from a Slack channel.</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">Our Way: One AI Agent. One Slack Channel. Full SEO Operation.</h2>
    <p class="reveal">When we launched <a href="https://getclawhelp.com" target="_blank" style="color: var(--frailejon-gold);">getclawhelp.com</a> — a content and lead-generation site targeting people who need help with OpenClaw — we didn't hire an SEO agency. We didn't subscribe to a stack of tools. We gave the job to Frailejón, our AI agent.</p>
    <p class="reveal">Everything runs through the <code>#getclawhelp</code> Slack channel. We describe what we need. The agent researches, plans, writes, builds, and deploys. The entire SEO and pSEO strategy — from keyword research to published pages — is managed by AI.</p>

    <div class="case-quote reveal">
      <p>"We gave the agent a single instruction. It came back with a full SEO strategy, started publishing pages, and hasn't stopped. That was day one."</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="reveal">What the AI Agent Handles</h2>
    <p class="reveal">This isn't "AI-assisted SEO." The agent <em>is</em> the SEO department — strategy, execution, and monitoring, end to end.</p>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">1</span> Keyword Research &amp; Competitive Analysis</div>
      <p>The agent identifies high-intent keywords, analyzes competitor content strategies, and finds gaps in the market — all automatically. Every piece of content is backed by data, not guesswork.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">2</span> Multi-Phase SEO Strategy</div>
      <p>Instead of chasing random keywords, the agent builds a phased strategy — starting with quick wins to establish authority, then progressively targeting higher-competition terms as the domain grows. It adapts the plan as results come in.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">3</span> Content Creation &amp; Publishing</div>
      <p>The agent plans, writes, optimizes, and publishes expert-depth content on a consistent schedule. Not thin AI filler — genuinely useful articles targeting specific search intents, complete with structured data and metadata. No human writer in the loop.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">4</span> Programmatic SEO at Scale</div>
      <p>The agent generates dozens of unique, locally relevant landing pages — each tailored to specific locations and use cases. These aren't thin doorway pages; they're genuinely useful content that ranks. What would take a dev team weeks happens automatically.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">5</span> Technical SEO Infrastructure</div>
      <p>Sitemaps, structured data, internal linking, page speed, crawlability — the agent handles the full technical SEO stack that most teams need a dedicated specialist for. It builds and maintains the infrastructure continuously.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">6</span> Competitive Monitoring &amp; Link Building</div>
      <p>The agent tracks the competitive landscape and identifies opportunities to build domain authority — staying ahead of market shifts without anyone watching dashboards.</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="reveal">The Numbers: 34+ Pages and Growing</h2>
    <p class="reveal">In less than a month, the AI agent built getclawhelp.com from nothing to a 34+ page site with a diverse content portfolio:</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">How Programmatic SEO Works With AI</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Programmatic SEO is one of the most effective growth strategies in digital marketing — and one of the hardest to execute. The traditional approach requires a developer to build template systems, a data engineer to manage the data pipeline, and a content strategist to ensure quality. Most startups can't afford the $5,000–$15,000 upfront build, let alone the ongoing maintenance.</p>
    <p class="reveal">Our AI agent eliminates all of that. Here's how it works:</p>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li><strong>Template generation:</strong> The agent creates HTML templates with dynamic placeholders for location names, service descriptions, local details, and CTAs.</li>
      <li><strong>Data pipeline:</strong> The agent builds and maintains data.json files — structured datasets containing city information, integration details, local statistics, and unique content for each page variant.</li>
      <li><strong>Page generation:</strong> Template + data = pages at scale. The agent combines templates with data to produce unique, high-quality landing pages — each with custom content, not just find-and-replace city names.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality control:</strong> Every generated page includes unique introductory copy, locally relevant details, proper structured data, and internal links. No thin content. No duplicate content penalties.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="case-quote reveal">
      <p>"The agent built our entire pSEO system in a day. Template generators, data pipelines, 10 city pages, integration pages — all from Slack. A pSEO agency would have charged $10,000+ and taken 6 weeks."</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="reveal">The Competitive Edge</h2>
    <p class="reveal">The agent doesn't just build pages — it thinks strategically. It tracks competitor sites like setupclaw.com and openclawexperts.io, analyzing their content coverage, keyword targets, and site architecture. When it identifies a content gap — a topic competitors haven't covered, a keyword they're missing, a user intent they're not serving — it flags it and produces content to fill the gap.</p>
    <p class="reveal">This creates a compounding advantage. Every week, getclawhelp.com publishes more expert-depth content than competitors can manually produce. The content velocity is simply unmatchable by traditional teams. And because the AI agent maintains perfect consistency in technical SEO, structured data, and internal linking across every page, the site's overall SEO health improves with every publication.</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">Why This Matters for Your Business</h2>
    <p class="reveal">SEO is one of the highest-ROI marketing channels — but only if you can afford to do it right. Most small businesses and startups can't justify $3,000–$5,000/month for a proper SEO operation. So they either do nothing, or they do it halfway and wonder why it doesn't work.</p>
    <p class="reveal">AI changes the equation entirely. The same strategy, the same content quality, the same technical execution — at a fraction of the cost. Not "AI-generated slop" that Google penalizes, but genuinely expert content built on real keyword research, competitive analysis, and strategic planning.</p>
    <p class="reveal">If your business needs SEO but can't afford an agency, you don't need to compromise. You need an AI agent.</p>
