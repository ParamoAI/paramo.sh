    <h2 class="reveal">The Situation</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Skillet'z Cafe is a family-run American breakfast diner with a Mexican twist in Fremont, California. Open just six hours a day — 8am to 2pm — the restaurant had built a loyal following over years of serving quality food with a personal touch.</p>
    <p class="reveal">The owner saw an opportunity: the kitchen sat idle for 18 hours a day. Expanding into dinner service, launching a boba shop next door, and scaling marketing all required bandwidth a small team simply didn't have.</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">The Problem</h2>
    <p class="reveal">The challenge wasn't just time — it was coordination. Every "5-minute task" carried hidden costs.</p>

    <div class="case-quote reveal">
      <p>"A 5-minute task actually has a total cost of an hour when you factor in the context switching plus the coordination across team members."</p>
    </div>

    <ul class="reveal">
      <li><strong>Marketing bottleneck</strong> — No dedicated team. Every flyer, coupon, and campaign required manual design work</li>
      <li><strong>No local outreach system</strong> — Over 40 schools within reach, but no way to manage sponsorship campaigns at scale</li>
      <li><strong>Revenue leakage</strong> — DoorDash disputes and chargebacks costing hundreds weekly — too many small amounts to contest individually</li>
      <li><strong>Menu update coordination</strong> — Every change required multi-step handoffs between designer, display system, and POS</li>
      <li><strong>No custom analytics</strong> — Off-the-shelf restaurant tools provided generic insights that didn't fit their operation</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">The Solution</h2>
    <p class="reveal">The owner deployed OpenClaw — a personal AI agent — as a central command center. Rather than subscribing to a dozen specialized SaaS tools, they trained one AI system that understood their business, their preferences, and their workflows.</p>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">1</span> AI Marketing Engine</div>
      <p>The AI generates complete marketing campaigns, print materials, flyers, and coupons on demand. When the team needed to promote the boba shop to neighbors, they described the goal and the AI produced ready-to-print materials — flyers with coupons for the farmer's market, awareness campaigns for the neighborhood.</p>
      <p>No graphic designer. No agency. No revision cycles.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">2</span> School Sponsorship Orchestrator</div>
      <p>The owner wanted to partner with local schools on fundraiser events — donate 20% of proceeds on a designated day. The AI identified <strong>40+ schools</strong> in the area, generated <strong>3 distinct campaign concepts</strong>, created an outreach plan for every principal, designed tracking with <strong>custom discount codes per school</strong>, and built reporting to calculate donation amounts automatically.</p>
      <p>Servers tap a button when a diner mentions their school. The system handles the rest.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">3</span> DoorDash Dispute Resolution</div>
      <p>Fraudulent chargebacks were a persistent drain — $5 here, $20 there, dozens of times per week. The cumulative loss was hundreds monthly. Worse, unresolved disputes threatened their "Most Loved" badge, which requires below a 2% error rate for premium placement.</p>
      <p>The AI automates the dispute process: reviewing each case, filing responses, and tracking outcomes. Revenue that previously walked out the door is now recovered systematically.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">4</span> Menu Display Sync</div>
      <p>Previously, updating TV menus was a multi-person relay: designer updates the menu → notifies admin → admin updates web app on all TVs → designer updates POS. Now the entire chain is automated. Menu changes propagate through the system without anyone stopping what they're doing.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="auto-card reveal">
      <div class="auto-card-title"><span class="auto-card-num">5</span> Custom Menu & Inventory Intelligence</div>
      <p>Rather than relying on generic restaurant analytics, the AI provides custom intelligence layered on top of their Toast POS data: item-level profitability, popularity trends, pricing optimization, and inventory forecasting — all tailored to Skillet'z Cafe's specific menu and margins.</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="reveal">The owner is candid: AI didn't make them less busy. It made them dramatically more productive.</p>

    <div class="case-quote reveal">
      <p>"I'm just as busy before AI and after AI, but I'm getting a lot more done — I'm a lot more productive."</p>
    </div>

    <p class="reveal">Each automation is valuable individually. Together, they create a compound effect — the AI understands the entire business, so insights from one area inform decisions in another. Menu analytics inform marketing. Dispute data informs operations. School outreach drives organic growth.</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">Why OpenClaw Over Off-the-Shelf SaaS</h2>

    <div class="case-quote reveal">
      <p>"OpenClaw has raised the floor of what the minimum expectation of an intelligent system is. I don't want to have to explain the same thing multiple times to each SaaS provider."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="case-quote reveal">
      <p>"It's like walking into a stereotypical SaaS — they give you a copy-and-paste version of their product that they expect you to adjust to. Whereas OpenClaw says: I will work for you to give you what you think is valuable."</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="reveal">The Lifestyle Impact</h2>
    <p class="reveal">The hidden ROI: the owner handles business operations from their phone while at the gym. Tasks that used to require a computer, team coordination, and context switching now happen asynchronously through chat.</p>

    <div class="case-quote reveal">
      <p>"It's like 5 minutes here, 5 minutes there, 15 minutes there — that's like I saved an hour. Now I can go to the gym."</p>
    </div>

    <h2 class="reveal">Looking Ahead</h2>
    <p class="reveal">Next phase: using the AI to generate employee handbooks and SOPs for 30+ employees, automating training materials, and creating procedures that previously lived only in people's heads.</p>

    <div class="case-quote reveal">
      <p>"When my kids are grown up and they help take over these businesses, they're already going to be moving at 60 miles an hour at the starting line."</p>
